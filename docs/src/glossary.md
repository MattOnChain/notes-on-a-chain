## Cursed Inscriptions
Inscriptions where negative numbers are displayed and inscriptions are counted backwards. Xverse, Hiro and other well-known wallets will not recognize Cursed Inscriptions and therefore Sparrow is the only wallet capable of handling them.

## Derivation Path
Refers to the hierarchical structure used to generate a sequence of cryptographic keys and addresses from a single master seed phrase. This structure is commonly known as the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet. The HD wallet uses the hierarchical key derivation algorithm (HD algorithm) to generate a tree-like structure of keys. This tree structure starts with a single master key, derived from the seed phrase, and branches out to generate child keys and addresses.

## Stamps
[Stamps](https://trustmachines.co/blog/bitcoin-stamps-and-how-they-work/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20Stamps%20are%20akin%20to,the%20witness%20data%20like%20Ordinals.) are not Ordinals, so they are not referenced in this document. They use the open-source [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) protocol that is built on the Bitcoin blockchain. Using the native Counterparty decentralized exchange and $XCP token, users can mint and trade digital assets stored on the Bitcoin chain.
