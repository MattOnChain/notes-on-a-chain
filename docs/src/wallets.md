# Wallets

There are many wallet applications from which to choose. Below is a recap of the most popular choices at the moment. For an expanded list, the [Links](links.md) section contains a list of the most common wallet options.

- [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/): If you are new to Ordinals, start with Xverse. It is the most widely supported wallet when it comes to web3 integrations with marketplaces and minting sites. It handles BTC in a separate address from that of your Ordinals. It also has special handling for BRC-20.
- [UniSat](https://unisat.io/download): Best for BRC-20 on account of its integration with the UniSat marketplace for BRC-20. Also handles Ordinals and BTC very well; all within a single address.
- [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/): Best for coin-control as is required to extract sats, pad Ordinals and more. Just make sure you know what you're doing when sending Ordinals from Sparrow.
