# Emblem Vault

[Emblem Vault](https://emblem.finance/) facilitates the storage and exchange of Ordinals on the ETH mainnet. Ordinals can be wrapped inside an Emblem Vault that is traded on OpenSea like any ETH NFT. At any time, the owner of the Emblem Vault can open the vault and move the Ordinal to their Ordinal wallet.

## Unlocking an Emblem Vault

1. Connect to emblem.finance with the ETH wallet that contains your vaulted Ordinals
2. My Vaults > Locked
3. Approve Minting to call the contract that opens the vault
4. Unlock Vault (Get Private Keys) to burn the ETH NFT and get the private key to the wallet holding the Ordinal
5. You will be required to purchase $COVAL, the currency used to pay the unlocking fee
6. Click Get Keys (if the keys don’t display, refresh the page until they do)
7. Copy the mnemonic phrase so it can be pasted to import into another wallet app (e.g. Sparrow)
8. Record and secure this seed phrase for as long as you need access to the wallet containing this Ordinal.

> Note: The Keys can be retrieved again in the future by going to your Unlocked vaults. You will only need to sign in MetaMask to retrieve the keys. This is not a transaction and therefore no gas is required.

## Importing the Wallet into Sparrow
1. In Sparrow, File > Import Wallet
2. Mnemonic Words: Use 12 Words
3. Paste the words by pasting the entire copied data into Word 1
4. Click Discover Wallet
5. Name the wallet to match the token being unlocked (e.g. Bitcoin Punk #1234)
6. Add a password if desired
7. Click on UTXOs to see the UTXO containing the Ordinal
8. If the UTXO does not show, try toggling the network connection at the bottom right of the screen
9. Label the UTXO like “Bitcoin Punk #1234”
10. As desired, transfer this Ordinal to your main Sparrow wallet following the normal Sparrow Send process
